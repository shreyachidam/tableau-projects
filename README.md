### üîç Project Summary

As part of a case study, I designed an interactive dashboard for a fictional company, **NexaData**, to support project management and financial analysis. This project demonstrates my ability to create impactful data visualizations while adhering to best practices in data privacy and confidentiality. By using a structured approach with high-level overviews and detailed drill-downs, this dashboard enables decision-makers to track project status and identify critical areas efficiently.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Approach

- **Budget Metrics**:  
  - `Budget Utilization` = `Actualized Budget` / `EAC`  
  - `Budget Variance` = `EAC` - `Actualized Budget`
- **Timeline Analysis**:  
  - Calculated project delay
